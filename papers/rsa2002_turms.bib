  abstract = 	 { In this paper we present a certified e-mail system which provides
                   fairness while making use of a $TTP$ only in exceptional 
                   circumstances. Our system guarantees that the recipient gets the 
                   content of the e-mail if and only if the sender receives an incontestable  
                   proof-of-receipt. Our protocol involves two communicating parties, a sender 
                   and a recipient, but only the recipient is allowed to misbehave. Therefore, 
                   in case of dispute, the sender solicits $TTP$'arbitration without involving 
                   the recipient. This feature makes our protocols very  attractive in real-world 
                   environments in which recipients would prefer to assume a passive role rather 
                   than being actively involved in dispute resolutions caused by malicious senders.  
                   In addition, in our protocol, the recipient can be stateless, i.e., it does 
                   not need to keep state to ensure fairness.
