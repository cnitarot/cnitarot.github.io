  abstract = 	 { An ad hoc wireless network is an autonomous self-organizing system of
                   mobile nodes connected by wireless links where nodes not in direct
                   range can communicate via intermediate nodes. A common technique used
                   in routing protocols for ad hoc wireless networks is to establish the
                   routing paths on-demand, as opposed to continually maintaining a
                   complete routing table. A significant concern in routing is the
                   ability to function in the presence of byzantine failures which
                   include nodes that drop, modify, or mis-route packets in an attempt to
                   disrupt the routing service.

                   We propose an on-demand routing protocol for ad hoc wireless networks
                   that provides resilience to byzantine failures caused by individual or
                   colluding nodes. Our adaptive probing technique detects a malicious
                   link after $\log n$ faults have occurred, where $n$ is the length of
                   the path. These links are then avoided by multiplicatively increasing
                   their weights and by using an on-demand route discovery protocol that
                   finds a least weight path to the destination.
