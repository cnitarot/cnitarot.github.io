  abstract = 	 { Group key agreement is a fundamental building block for secure peer group
                   communication systems. Several group key agreement protocols were proposed 
                   in the last decade, all of them assuming the existence of an underlying 
                   group communication infrastructure. 

                   This paper presents a performance evaluation of five notable key agreement
                   protocols for peer groups, integrated with a reliable group communication
                   system (Spread). They are: Centralized Group Key Distribution (CKD), 
                   Burmester-Desmedt (BD), Steer et al. (STR), Group Diffie-Hellman (GDH) and 
                   Tree-Based Group Diffie-Hellman (TGDH). The paper includes an in-depth 
                   comparison and analysis of conceptual results and is the first to report 
                   practical results in real-life local and wide area networks. Our analysis 
                   of these protocols' experimental results offers insights into their scalability 
                   and practicality.
