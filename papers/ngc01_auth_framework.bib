  abstract = 	 { Researchers have made much progress in designing secure and scalable 
                   protocols to provide specific security services, such as data secrecy, 
                   data integrity, entity authentication and access control, to multicast 
                   and group applications. However, less emphasis has been put on how to 
                   integrate security protocols with modern, highly efficient group communication 
                   systems and what issues arise in such secure group communication systems. 
                   In this paper, we present a flexible and modular architecture for integrating 
                   many different authentication and access control policies and protocols with 
                   an existing group communication system, while allowing applications to provide 
                   their own protocols and control the policies. This architecture maintains, as 
                   much as possible, the scalability and performance characteristics of the unsecure 
                   system. We discuss some of the challenges when designing such a framework and show 
                   its implementation in the Spread wide-area group communication toolkit.  
                  }
