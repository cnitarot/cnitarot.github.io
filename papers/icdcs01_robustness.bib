  abstract = 	 { Secure group communication is crucial for building distributed 
                   applications that work in dynamic environments and communicate 
                   over unsecured networks (e.g. the Internet). Key agreement is a 
                   critical part of providing security services for group communication 
                   systems. Most of the current contributory key agreement protocols 
                   are not designed to tolerate failures and membership changes during 
                   execution. In particular, nested or cascaded group membership events 
                   (such as partitions) are not accommodated.

                   In this paper we present the first robust contributory key agreement 
                   protocols resilient to any sequence of events while preserving the 
                   group communication membership and ordering guarantees.
