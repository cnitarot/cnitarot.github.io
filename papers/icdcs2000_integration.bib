  abstract = 	 { Increasing popularity and diversity of collaborative applications 
                   prompts the need for highly secure and reliable communication 
                   platforms for dynamic peer groups. Security mechanisms for such 
                   groups tend to be both expensive and complex and their integration 
                   with reliable group communication services presents a formidable 
                   challenge.  

                   This paper discusses some important integration issues, reports 
                   on the implementation experience and provides experimental results.
                   Our approach utilizes distributed group key management developed 
                   by the Cliques project. We enhance it to handle processor and 
                   network faults (under a fail-stop or crash-and-recover model) and 
                   asynchronous membership events (such as cascading joins, leaves, 
                   merges and network partitions). Our approach leverages the strong 
                   properties provided by the Spread group communication system, such 
                   as message ordering, clean failure semantics and a membership service. 
                   The result of this work is a secure group communications layer and an 
                   API which provide the application programmer both standard group 
                   services as well as flexible security services.
