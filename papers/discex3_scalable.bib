  abstract = 	 { This paper proposes several integrated security architecture designs
                   for client-server group communication systems. In an integrated
                   architecture, security services are implemented in servers, in
                   contrast to a layered architecture where the same services are
                   implemented in clients.  We discuss the performance and accompanying
                   trust issues of each proposed architecture and present experimental
                   results that demonstrate the superior scalability of an integrated
                   architecture.
