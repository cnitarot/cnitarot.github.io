<p> This page is intended for undergraduate students who would like to know
more about the benefits of doing research, the opportunities available to them,
the best time to get engaged in research, 
and the possible outcomes of a research activity.  For further information, direct
your questions to c.nitarotaru@northeastern.edu.
   
<h4> <a name="why"> Why you should do research (even if you don't want to go to graduate school). </a></h4>

<p>  Most students think that they should not do research because they do not want to go to
graduate school. However, doing research brings many benefits, regardless of what career
path somebody might want to pursue. Here are some of them:

<ul>
<li> Learn something you will not learn in any class
<li> Get more from college through interactions beyond those with your peers
<li> Prepare to make more informed career decisions
<li> Know yourself better
<li> Learn how to deal with  (life's) uncertainty
<li> Advance humanity's knowledge
</ul>

A successful research experience should require you to interact with a faculty advisor, several Ph.D. students,
participate in a lab's activities, and learn more about career opportunities. It should allow you to learn something
you have not already learned in a class, and provide a safe place for you to fail. That's right,  you need to learn
how to fail in order to succeed.


<h4> <a name="how"> How you can do research as an undergraduate student.</a></h4>

<p> Most opportunities to do research come in three forms: class related work
for which you receive credit, employment for which you get paid, or none of these -- you can engage
in research outside the academic structure and without getting paid.
Below are some examples:

<ul>
<li> Take an independent study
<li> Do a research internship
<li> Do a research co-op
<li> Work on a project outside class
<li> Do a capstone, honors project, or thesis
</ul>

A subset of these opportunities exist at most schools. Internships are available also at other schools
than the one you are attending.
Some schools have programs only for undergraduates - these programs allow more interactions with
peer undergraduate researchers and faculty, but not Ph.D. students. 
When choosing a project, be aware if it advances your knowledge, or it just requires you to use existing 
(programming) skills. A good research project pushes you a bit outside of your comfort zone.

<h4> <a name="when"> When is the best time to do research as an undergraduate student.</a></h4>

<p> The best time to get involved in research varies based on the topic, the classes taken, and schedule
constraints. For most students, junior year is a good time to pursue a research project in depth. 
Starting earlier might allow you to learn the mechanics of research and become more independent
in your own projects, but if you have not taken some of the foundational classes in computer science
you might end up spending your time more on the needed background (that you will also eventually learn
in a class) than on the advanced topics
themselves. The goal is to learn something that you did not (or would learn) in a class. 
Talking with a faculty can provide better guidance on choosing the best path for you.
Many schools have some introductory classes on research and that can serve as a starting point
for making connections with faculty. 
</p>

<p> Depending on your goals you might need to do research more than one semester. You can use
any of the opportunities described above in a combination to achieve your goals. Examples of these goals
can be publishing a paper, finishing an implementation, finishing some evaluation in depth. 
Most in-depth projects require two semesters. This timeframe can be achieved for example, by
starting with doing a project for credit during the semester and continuing more in depth during the
summer with an internship. 
</p>

<h4> <a name="what"> What are the outcomes of an undergraduate research project. </a></h4>

<ul>
<li> Code 
<li> Report
<li> Thesis
<li> Article published in a peer-reviewed conference
</ul>


<p> As a faculty at Purdue University and Northeastern University I have advised 
over 37 undergraduate students in research. Often this  research resulted in papers published in peer-reviewed 
conferences. Several of these students won CRA Undergraduate Research Awards
and later went to graduate school and are now professors. Other had very successful careers
in industry.

Below are some examples of papers from my group which
have undergraduate students as co-authors. If you want to get involved 
you can learn more about our projects
