<p> <strong> I am looking for motivated postdoctoral researchers and graduate students
to join my group. Areas of interest are: theoretical and empirical analysis of secure 
communication protocols, automated verification of distributed systems and network protocols,
automated text interpretation with application to security and privacy,
adversarial machine learning.

<p>
Cristina Nita-Rotaru is a Professor of Computer Science in the College of Computing and Information Science
at Northeastern University. Prior to joining Northeastern she was a faculty in the Department of Computer 
Science at Purdue University (<a href="http://homes.cerias.purdue.edu/~crisn/"> page at Purdue </a>).
Her research lies at the intersection of information security, 
distributed systems, and computer networks. The overarching goal of her 
work is designing and building practical distributed systems and network
protocols that are robust to failures and attacks while coping with the resource 
constraints existent in computing systems and networks. 


<p>
Cristina Nita-Rotaru is a recipient of the NSF Career Award in 2006. She is also a recipient of 
Purdue College of Science Research Award in 2013, Purdue Excellence in Research Award, Seeds for Success in 2012,
Purdue College of Science Leadership Award, 2012,
Purdue College of Science Undergraduate Advising Award in 2008, and
Purdue Teaching for Tomorrow Award in 2007.
She has served on the Technical Program Committee of numerous conferences in security, networking and distributed systems (IEEE S&P, USENIX Security, ACM CCS, NDSS, ACM Wisec, IEEE ICDCS, IEEE/IFIP DSN, ACM SIGCOMM, ACM CoNEXT, IEEE INFOCOM, IEEE ICNP, WWW). 
She served as an Assistant Director for CERIAS (2011 - 2013). 
She is a member of the steering committee of ACM Wisec and a member of the IFIP Working Group on Dependable Computing and Fault-tolerance. 
She was an Associate Editor for 
Elsevier Computer Communications (2008 - 2011), 
IEEE Transactions on Computers (2011 - 2014), 
ACM Transactions on Information Systems Security (2009 - 2013), and Computer Networks (2012 - 2014).
She is currently an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing and IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Systems.
