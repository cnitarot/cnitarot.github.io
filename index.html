<p>
Cristina Nita-Rotaru is a Professor of Computer Science in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University where she leads the Network and Distributed Systems Security Laboratory (NDS2) and is a founding member of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute. Prior to joining Northeastern she was a faculty in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University (2003 - 2015). She served as an Associate Dean of Faculty at Northeastern University (2017 - 2020) and as an Assistant Director for CERIAS at Purdue University (2011 - 2013). Her research lies at the intersection of cybersecurity, distributed systems, and computer networks. The overarching goal of her work is designing and building resilient distributed systems and network protocols that are resilient to faults, misconfigurations, and attacks. Her research has been funded by NSF, DARPA, ONR, Verisign, Toyota ITC, Visa Research, PwC, Google, UBRI, CISCO, Verizon, and Ethereum Foundation. Her work received several best paper awards in NETYS 2023, ACM SACMAT 2022, IEEE SafeThings 2019, NDSS 2018, ISSRE 2017, DSN 2015, two IETF/IRTF Applied Networking Research Prize in 2018 and 2016, and Test-of-Time award in ACM SACMAT 2022. She is a recipient of the NSF Career Award in 2006.


<p>
Cristina Nita-Rotaru is also a recipient of 
Purdue College of Science Research Award in 2013, Purdue Excellence in Research Award, Seeds for Success in 2012,
Purdue College of Science Leadership Award, 2012,
Purdue College of Science Undergraduate Advising Award in 2008, and
Purdue Teaching for Tomorrow Award in 2007.
Cristina Nita-Rotaru has served on the program committee of numerous conferences in networking, distributed systems and security such as ISOC NDSS, IEEE S&P,  IEEE Euro S&P, IEEE/IFIP DSN,  IEEE ICNP,  IEEE ICDCS, IEEE INFOCOM,
ACM CCS, ACM Wisec,  ACM SOCC, ACM SIGCOMM, ACM CoNEXT, ACM Web, ACM Eurosys, ASPLOS, USENIX Security,  USENIX OSDI, USENIX ATC. She was an Associate Editor for Elsevier Computer Communications (2008 - 2011), IEEE Transactions on Computers (2011 - 2014), ACM Transactions on Information Systems Security (2009 - 2013), Computer Networks (2012 - 2014), IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (2011 - 2016), and IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Systems (2013 - 2017). She was a member of the steering committee of ISOC NDSS, ACM Wisec, and IEEE/IFIP DSN. She was a general chair for IEEE DSN 2022 and ISOC NDSS 2023, 2024, and a chair of the Steering Group of NDSS 2024. She was a chair of the CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Research Award Committee (2019, 2020). She is currently a member of the IFIP Working Group on Dependable Computing and Fault-tolerance and the Steering Committee of ACM SACMAT, the Vice-Chair of the IEEE Technical Community on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance (TCFT), and the co-chair of IEEE S&P 2025.

<p>
My research lies at the intersection of information security, distributed systems, and computer networks. The overarching goal of my work is creating and building robust distributed systems and network protocols that achieve their security, availability, and performance design goals in spite of misconfigurations, failures, and attacks. My research combines theoretical principles and experimental methodologies from distributed systems, cryptography, networking, information theory, machine learning, formal methods, and software engineering to create systems and protocols based on provable guarantees and validated in realistic network environments.<br><br>

My research has been funded by NSF, DARPA, ONR, Verisign, Toyota ITC, Visa Research, PwC, Google, UBRI, CISCO, Verizon, Ethereum Foundation. <br><br>
