<p>
Cristina Nita-Rotaru is a Professor of Computer Science in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences
at Northeastern University. Prior to joining Northeastern she was a faculty in the Department of Computer 
Science at Purdue University from 2003 to 2015.
Her research lies at the intersection of security, 
distributed systems, and computer networks. The overarching goal of her 
work is designing and building secure and resilient distributed systems and network protocols, 
with assurance that their deployed implementations provide their security, resilience, and performance goals.
Her work received several best paper awards in IEEE SafeThings 2019, NDSS 2018, ISSRE 2017, DSN 2015 
as well as two IETF/IRTF Applied Networking Research Prize in 2018 and 2016.


<p>
Cristina Nita-Rotaru is a recipient of the NSF Career Award in 2006. She is also a recipient of 
Purdue College of Science Research Award in 2013, Purdue Excellence in Research Award, Seeds for Success in 2012,
Purdue College of Science Leadership Award, 2012,
Purdue College of Science Undergraduate Advising Award in 2008, and
Purdue Teaching for Tomorrow Award in 2007.
She has served on the Technical Program Committee of numerous conferences in security, networking and distributed systems (IEEE S&P, USENIX Security, ACM CCS, NDSS, ACM Wisec, IEEE ICDCS, IEEE/IFIP DSN, ACM SIGCOMM, ACM CoNEXT, IEEE INFOCOM, IEEE ICNP, WWW, Eurosys). 
She served as an Assistant Director for CERIAS (2011 - 2013). 
She is a member of the steering committee of ACM Wisec and IEEE/IFIP DSN, and a member of the IFIP Working Group on Dependable Computing and Fault-tolerance. 
She was an Associate Editor for 
Elsevier Computer Communications (2008 - 2011), 
IEEE Transactions on Computers (2011 - 2014), 
ACM Transactions on Information Systems Security (2009 - 2013),
   Computer Networks (2012 - 2014),
   and IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (2011 - 2016), and 
  IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Systems (2013 - 2017).

<p>
Cristina Nita-Rotaru holds a Ph.D in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins
University</a> and a MS from <a href="http://www.acs.pub.ro">Politehnica University of Bucharest</a>, Romania. 
She was born and grew up in Bucharest, Romania. She is an alumnus of

<h3> <a name="research">Research</a> </h3>
<p>
My research lies at the intersection of information security, distributed systems, and computer networks. The overarching goal of my work is creating and building robust distributed systems and network protocols that achieve their security, availability, and performance design goals in spite of misconfigurations, failures, and attacks. My research combines theoretical principles and experimental methodologies from distributed systems, cryptography, networking, information theory, machine learning, and software engineering to create systems and protocols based on provable guarantees and validated in realistic network environments.<br><br>

My research has been funded by NSF, DARPA, Verisign, Toyota ITC, Visa Research, PwC, Google, Ripple.<br><br>
